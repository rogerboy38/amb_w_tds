## [5.0.3] - 2025-10-11 - üêõ Critical Bug Fixes & UX Enhancements

### üêõ Fixed

#### Critical App Discovery Bug
- **Issue**: Interactive command was only showing apps installed on the current site, not all apps available in the bench
- **Root Cause**: Used site-specific app query instead of bench-level app discovery
- **Fix**: Now uses `frappe.get_installed_apps()` to discover ALL apps in the bench's `apps/` directory
- **Impact**: Users can now see and select from all available apps in their bench, not just site-installed ones
- **Files Modified**: `app_migrator/commands/enhanced_interactive_wizard.py`

#### Performance Hang Fix
- **Issue**: Command would hang when scanning large app directories with many modules
- **Fix**: Optimized app scanning and module classification algorithms
- **Impact**: Significantly faster response times, especially for large ERPNext installations

### ‚ú® Added

#### Zero-Module App Handler
- **Feature**: Apps with zero modules now display a `(0 modules)` tag in the selection list
- **Enhanced Workflow**: When a user selects an app with 0 modules, they are now prompted with helpful options:
  - Try selecting another app
  - View app details
  - Exit the wizard
- **User Experience**: Prevents confusion and provides clear guidance for edge cases
- **Implementation**: `select_app()` function now returns either a string (app name) or dict (action)

### üîß Changed

#### Function Signature Updates
- **`select_app()` return type**: Changed from `str` to `str | dict` to support new workflows
- **Calling Code**: All internal code that calls `select_app()` updated to handle both return types
- **Example**:
  ```python
  # New pattern
  result = select_app(apps)
  if isinstance(result, dict):
      # Handle special action (e.g., zero-module case)
      handle_action(result)
  else:
      # Normal flow - result is an app name
      process_app(result)
  ```

### üìö Documentation

- **Added**: `SESSION_HANDOUT.md` - Comprehensive handout for session transitions and AI agent context
- **Updated**: `AI_AGENT_TECHNICAL_SPECS.md` - Added v5.0.3 function signatures and API changes
- **Updated**: `CHANGELOG.md` - This file

### üîí Breaking Changes

- **None for end users**: All changes are internal
- **Internal API**: `select_app()` function signature changed - requires type checking by callers
- **Migration**: All internal calling code has been updated in this release

### üéì Lessons Learned

1. **App Discovery**: Always use framework-level APIs (`frappe.get_installed_apps()`) for bench-wide operations
2. **Zero States**: Proper handling of edge cases (like 0 modules) significantly improves UX
3. **Performance**: Large directory scans need optimization from the start
4. **Type Safety**: When changing return types, ensure all callers are updated

### üìù Migration Guide from v5.0.2

**For Users**:
- No action required - just pull the latest version
- Interactive command will now show all available apps

**For Developers**:
- If you have custom code calling `select_app()`, update to handle dict returns:
  ```python
  result = select_app(apps)
  if isinstance(result, dict):
      # New: Handle action dict
      pass
  else:
      # Existing: Handle app name string
      pass
  ```

## [5.0.2] - 2025-10-11 - üîß Build System Fix

### üêõ Fixed
- **Build Error Resolution**
  - Fixed esbuild build failure caused by incorrect asset path format in hooks.py
  - Changed from bundle format (`app_migrator.bundle.js`) to absolute paths (`/assets/app_migrator/js/app_migrator.js`)
  - Aligns with bench new-app standards for proper asset resolution

### üìÅ Structure Improvements
- **Added Missing Directories**
  - Created `templates/includes/` directory for Jinja template includes
  - Added `www/` directory for static web content
  - Added proper `__init__.py` files to maintain Python package structure

### üéì Lessons Learned
- esbuild requires absolute asset paths starting with `/assets/`
- All Frappe apps should follow bench new-app structure standards
- Proper directory structure is critical for build success

### üîÑ Migration from v5.0.1
- Complete rebuild using bench new-app as foundation
- Merged all custom code (commands/, utils/, public assets)
- Maintained all functionality while fixing build issues
