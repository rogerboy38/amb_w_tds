🔍 MULTI-BENCH ECOSYSTEM ANALYSIS
==================================================
📋 Found 4 benches:

📦 frappe-bench (12 apps)
📦 frappe-bench-bak16 (0 apps)
📦 frappe-bench-clean (2 apps)
📦 frappe-bench-migration (6 apps)

📈 SYSTEM SUMMARY: 4 benches, 20 total apps

Smart Recommendation
text

🧠 SMART MIGRATION RECOMMENDATION
==================================================
🎯 RECOMMENDED MIGRATION PATH:
   🚀 SOURCE: frappe-bench (12 apps)
   🎯 TARGET: frappe-bench-bak16 (0 apps)

📦 RECOMMENDED APPS TO MIGRATE:
   • payments
   • migration_test_target
   • amb_w_spc3

💡 QUICK MIGRATION COMMAND:
   cd /home/frappe/frappe-bench-bak16
   bench get-app payments /home/frappe/frappe-bench/apps/payments
   bench --site [site_name] install-app payments

🏢 Enterprise Use Cases
Development Workflow

    Develop in frappe-bench (feature development)

    Test in frappe-bench-migration (integration testing)

    Stage in frappe-bench-clean (user acceptance testing)

    Deploy to frappe-bench-bak16 (production-like)

Database Separation

    Each bench connects to different databases

    Supports dedicated database servers (e.g., 192.168.1.31)

    Maintains complete environment isolation

Git Integration

    Professional version control workflow

    Force push capability for major updates

    Consistent deployment across all benches

🔧 Advanced Configuration
Custom Bench Paths

The system automatically detects benches in:

    /home/frappe/

    User home directory

    Standard Frappe bench locations

Database Configuration

Supports both:

    Local database servers

    Remote dedicated servers

    Custom port configurations

🚨 Troubleshooting
Common Issues

    Bench not detected: Ensure proper bench structure (apps/, sites/, config/)

    Redis connection errors: Start bench services with bench start

    Git remote issues: Configure proper SSH keys for GitHub

Debug Commands
bash

# Check bench structure
ls -la /home/frappe/frappe-bench-*

# Verify git remote
cd apps/app_migrator && git remote -v

# Test Redis connection
bench --site <site> console

🔮 Roadmap
Planned Features

    Interactive bench discovery

    Bench health monitoring

    Migration history tracking

    Rollback capabilities

    Batch migration operations

    Environment synchronization
