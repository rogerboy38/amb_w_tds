# 🏭 ERPNext Installation Verification Procedure
## Step 14-3: Comprehensive ERPNext Health Check

> **✅ VERIFIED & BATTLE-TESTED** - Successfully validated on sysmayal.v.frappe.cloud

## 📋 Overview

This procedure verifies that ERPNext is properly installed, configured, and ready for production use. It covers core functionality, manufacturing modules, and system performance.

## 🎯 Prerequisites

- Frappe Bench installed
- ERPNext app installed
- Active site configured

## 🔧 Verification Steps

### Step 14-3-1: Verify ERPNext Installation Status

```bash
# Check installed apps
bench --site all list-apps

# Verify ERPNext is installed
if bench list-apps | grep -q "erpnext"; then
    echo "✅ ERPNext app is installed"
else
    echo "❌ ERPNext app not found"
    exit 1
fi

Step 14-3-2: Comprehensive Health Check
bash

# Use App Migrator for detailed status check
bench migrate-app check-erpnext-status

# Run bench doctor for system health
bench doctor

Step 14-3-3: Core ERPNext Functionality Test
bash

export FRAPPE_SITE=your_site_name
bench console << 'PYTHON'
import frappe

print("🚀 Testing ERPNext Core Operations...")

# Test critical ERPNext doctypes
critical_doctypes = ["Item", "Customer", "Supplier", "Sales Invoice", "Purchase Invoice"]

success_count = 0
for doctype in critical_doctypes:
    if frappe.db.exists("DocType", doctype):
        count = frappe.db.count(doctype)
        print(f"   ✅ {doctype}: EXISTS ({count} records)")
        success_count += 1
    else:
        print(f"   ❌ {doctype}: MISSING")

print(f"🎯 {success_count}/{len(critical_doctypes)} core doctypes verified")
PYTHON

unset FRAPPE_SITE

Step 14-3-4: Manufacturing Module Verification
bash

export FRAPPE_SITE=your_site_name
bench console << 'PYTHON'
import frappe

print("🏭 Manufacturing Module Verification")

manufacturing_doctypes = [
    "Work Order", "BOM", "BOM Item", "Production Plan", 
    "Stock Entry", "Item", "Warehouse", "Workstation", 
    "Operation", "Routing"
]

available_count = 0
print("📋 Checking manufacturing doctypes:")
for doctype in manufacturing_doctypes:
    if frappe.db.exists("DocType", doctype):
        print(f"   ✅ {doctype} - AVAILABLE")
        available_count += 1
    else:
        print(f"   ❌ {doctype} - MISSING")

print(f"🎯 {available_count}/{len(manufacturing_doctypes)} manufacturing doctypes available")

# Check manufacturing module installation
manufacturing_module = frappe.db.get_value("Module Def", "Manufacturing")
if manufacturing_module:
    print("✅ Manufacturing module: INSTALLED")
else:
    print("❌ Manufacturing module: NOT INSTALLED")
PYTHON

unset FRAPPE_SITE

Step 14-3-5: System Performance Check
bash

echo "💾 Memory Usage:"
free -h | grep -E "Mem:|Swap:"

echo "💿 Disk Space:"
df -h /home/frappe/frappe-bench

echo "🔧 Bench Services Status:"
bench --site all show-config | grep -E "(gunicorn_workers|background_workers|redis|db_host)"

Step 14-3-6: Final Verification Report
bash

echo "🏆 ERPNext VERIFICATION REPORT"
echo "=============================="
echo "📅 $(date)"
echo ""

echo "📦 INSTALLED APPS:"
bench list-apps

echo ""
echo "🌐 SITE CONFIGURATION:"
bench --site all show-config | grep -E "(default_site|db_name|db_host)"

🎯 Success Criteria

    ✅ ERPNext Installation: App appears in installed apps list

    ✅ Core Doctypes: All 5 critical doctypes available

    ✅ Manufacturing Module: All 10 manufacturing doctypes available

    ✅ System Health: Bench doctor reports no critical issues

    ✅ Performance: Adequate memory and disk space available
